# Portfolio
Building my portfolio.

The portfolio is available online at this address : http://romainsire.com  
Please consider that I'm a beginner developper, so if you notice a security breach, please feel free to report it or even correct it here on GitHub!

## Context
I builded my portfolio after a 3 month training at 3W Academy school (https://3wa.fr/)  
The portfolio is the last step to validate this 3 month training.  
I was working at my engineering job while I was building the Portfolio on my free time. That's why it took a while..

## About the code
Purposely, I didn't use any framework for this project. As a consequence the code is not the cleanest nor the most organised, but I did my best to keep it easily understandable.  
The Portfolio has a fairly large "admin" section, much bigger than the "public" section.. which is very frustrating because I'm theoretically the only one to have access to it!

## What's next? Many things!  
For the V2 of the Portfolio:  
* SSH certification for a https website
* Better code organization, including:
  - Use a router (AltoRouter may be a good option)  
  - Use an autoloader and namespaces  
  - A "public" folder which will be the only one reachable from outside  
  - more "object" oriented: "models", etc.  


Additional features to implement:
* Sort realisation by category on the public "realisations" page
* reCAPTCHA for the contact page
* Update of the pdf CV on the admin section
* Implement a admin dashboard, with many useful stats (visit counter, etc.)
* Thumbnail feature for the images (too slow at the moment)

For the V3 of the Portfolio:
* Use and learn a PHP framework such as Symfony or Laravel
